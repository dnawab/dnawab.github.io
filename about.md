## About

My name is Daniel Nawab. I am a Chartered Professional Accountant and have years of experience in accounting and operational finance. I love computers and admire how they have made our lives easier and better. I have been on several software development projects. Progress in technologies does not often quickly translate to the needs of accountants, and a gap exists between software owners and developers. By learning more about computers, I intend to do research work in this area and reduce this gap so accountants can also reap the benefits of IT like the general public.
